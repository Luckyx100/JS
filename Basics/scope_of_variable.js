//let name = "Lucky";  
//let name = "Kumar";   --> Giving error, let can't be used for same variables
//console.log(name);   // scope of let is only in the block of code (brackets) & can't be used outside the brackets

var name = "Lucky"
var name = "Kumar"   // var can be used anywhere in the code.....large scope
console.log(name)

// So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
